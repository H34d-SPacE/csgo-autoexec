// Crosshair Customization
// #######################
// See this picture for basic crosshair adjustments: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=799950821
// Also keep in mind that the same settings for size, thickness and gap look different on other resolutions. That means:  
// Using olofmeisters crosshair settings on 1920x1080 looks different on your screen than on his screen where he plays on 1024x768.

	// 2 = Classic (default)		- Crosshair is slightly dynamic when moving and gives separated feedback when firing (this crosshair offers the most customization).
	// 3 = Classic Dynamic			- Crosshair is very dynamic/expands a lot when moving and gives smooth feedback when firing.
	// 4 = Classic Static			- Crosshair is completely static on movement and when firing weapons.
